# Microservices with FastAPI

Prepared for Calgary / Edmonton Python Bootcamp 2020

## Prerequisites

- Knowledge of Python basics
    - variables, naming convention, loops, functions, classes,
      object-oriented programming, testing, best practices
    - Attendance at sessions 1 and 2 of the bootcamp is satisfactory
- Understanding of RESTful web APIs
    - What are RESTful APIs? How do we start thinking about them
      in Python?
    - Provided by [Zero To API](https://github.com/dgmouris/zero_to_api)

## Environment

- Virtual environment with Python 3.7+ (I will probably use conda)
- Jupyter notebook or Google Colab
- IDE for writing code
- Terminal for executing code (likely this is possible from the IDE, but
  I will just use basic mac terminal)
- RESTful client (I usually just use Jupyter notebooks and Python requests)

_Note:_ The setup from [Zero To API](https://github.com/dgmouris/zero_to_api#prerequistes-to-follow-the-presentation)
should be satisfactory for this presentation as well, as long as Python is
3.7+.

## Overview

- We will start by covering a few additional prerequisite topics for
  understanding FastAPI
    - Declarative programming with dataclasses and pydantic
    - Decorators
    - Async with asyncio
- Next, we will then talk about microservices
    - Pros, cons, comparison to monolith and realistic architectures
    - No coding for this part!
- Finally, FastAPI!
    - What is it? Why is it great?
    - Building an example application together
